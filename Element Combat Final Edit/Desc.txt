Element Combat (Temporary name)

To open in Unity, go to assets -> scenes -> Menu.unity

You can playtest the game there, as well as look into any script.
I have tried adding information to all scripts, so they should be understandable.
Otherwise contact me and I'll try to get around adding an explanation.
